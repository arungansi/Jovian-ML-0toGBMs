    "2. We have missing “seconds_in_bucket” field?.A: That means there is no related market activities during the last second. For book data you can also assume the top-2 level book shape stays the same as the last available book update within the gap seconds, or, in another word, <font color='red'> you can forward fill the missing data point for all field in book data.</font>\n",
    "3. I'm trying to make trade data fixed sized. Since missing seconds_in_bucket implies no trade happening within that one-second window, is it technically correct to resample trade data to 600 seconds and fill it with zeros?. Hi, it is correct to assume 0 for order count and size. Some assumptions are required for the price, though. A price of 0 might cause issues.\n",
    "4. the trade data at T seconds contains a 1-second aggregation of executed orders between [T, T+1 second]\n",
    "5. One time_id represents a unique 20-minutes trading window which is consistent across all stocks As an example, let’s say time_id = 1 is representing a window between 1900-01-01 12:00:00 and 1900-01-01 12:20:00, then the book data of all stocks for that time_id are is taken from the same window. The data in the first 10 minutes window is shared with all of you, while the order book data of the second 10-minutes is used to build the target for you to predict. The dataset is rolling in such a way that feature and target data will always have zero overlap. Note that time_id is randomly shuffled, so it will not contain any information other than serving as a bridge between different dataset.\n",
    "6. We can demonstrate the data structure in below way:\n",
    "<img src = https://www.optiver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DataBucketing.png>\n",
    "7. In our competition, we shared the last snapshot of order book for each second. Imagine you have a time_id starting from 1900-01-01 12:00:00, the book update data on seconds_in_bucket = 1 represents the last snapshot of order book update between 12:00:00 and 12:00:01. Similarly to order book data in terms of granularity, but the trade data represents the aggregation of all individual orders happened within one second.\n",
    "8. So per stock, under the same time_id, the trade data on seconds_in_bucket = 1 represents the aggregation of all individual executed orders between 12:00:00 and 12:00:01. The size is the sum of the size in each individual order, while the price is aggregated as a volume weighted average price of all trades. A straightforward WAP formula can be found on Investopedia.\n",
    "9. Q: Why we have missing “seconds_in_bucket” field?\n",
    "A: That means there is no related market activities during the last second.\n",

    "For book data you can also assume the top-2 level book shape stays the same as the last available book update within the gap seconds, or, in another word, you can forward fill the missing data point for all field in book data. For trade data, it implies no trade happening within that one-second window. One thing to note that trade data tends to be more sparse than book data in many cases.\n",

    "How can we compare the price of a stock between yesterday and today?\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest method would be to just take the difference. This is definitely the most intuitive way, however price differences are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested \\$ 1000 in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from  \\$ 100 to  \\$ 102 and stock B moves from  \\$ 10 to  \\$ 11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ( \\$1000 / \\$100=10 ) which led to a profit of  10⋅(\\$102−\\$100)=\\$20  and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock A, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the stock return. In our example, the return for stock A was  \\$102−\\$100/\\$100=2% , while for stock B it was  \\$11−\\$10/\\$10=10% . The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns are widely used in finance, however log returns are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling  St  the price of the stock  S  at time  t , we can define the log return between  t1  and  t2  as:\n",

    " - r(t1,t2)=log(St2/St1)\n",
    " \n",
    "Usually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean  rt=rt−10min,t .\n",
